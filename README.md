# Astrology AI Backend

Real-time horoscope text generation. The project consists of text generation using [OpenAI's GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).

We used [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to build the API of the gpt-2 model, and [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to upload the model to github.

The astrology ai webapp is on the [following repo](https://github.com/ericklarac/astrology-ai-webapp).

The API was deployed using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers on Google cloud.
